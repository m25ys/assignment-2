# AI Usage Report

## Tools and use cases
- Cursor: Assisted with scaffolding the HTML structure, generating CSS patterns (design tokens, responsive layout), and suggesting JavaScript utilities for theme toggling, smooth scrolling focus handling, and form validation/export.
- ChatGPT: Helped refine prompts, iterate on copy, and review code for readability and accessibility.

## Benefits and challenges
- Benefits: Significant acceleration in producing a clean baseline UI and utility code; quicker iteration on copy and structure; helpful guidance on accessibility and responsive design patterns.
- Challenges: Ensuring consistency and correctness across AI‑generated snippets; tailoring generic suggestions to the project’s real content; investing time to produce clear and complete documentation.

## Learning outcomes
- Improved ability to write concise, user‑focused documentation that explains structure and runtime behavior
- Better prompt engineering to guide AI toward project‑appropriate outcomes
- Stronger code review habits to validate AI output against requirements and standards

## Responsible adaptation of AI suggestions
- Provided clear prompts and constraints, including desired sections, theme behavior, and form requirements
- Kept AI output within scope by supplying a concrete base and integrating only relevant changes
- Manually edited the About/Experience content and refined copy to match real work and tone
- Reviewed and adjusted accessibility (e.g., focus management) and performance choices (e.g., lazy loading, CSS variables)
