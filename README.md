# Mohammed Portfolio – SWE363 Assignment 1

## Project description
This is a simple, responsive personal portfolio for Mohammed (ML focus). It includes:
- About, Experience, Projects, and Contact sections
- Light/Dark theme toggle with system-preference detection and persistence
- Time-based greeting
- Accessible smooth navigation
- Contact form with client-side validation, local saving (localStorage), and exporting messages to `.txt`

Main files:
- `index.html` – page markup and sections
- `styles.css` – modern, responsive styling for light/dark themes
- `script.js` – greeting, theme toggle, smooth scroll, and contact form logic

## Setup instructions (run locally)
You can run the site with VS Code and the Live Server extension:
1. Open VS Code and clone/download this folder.
2. Open the project folder in VS Code.
3. Install the "Live Server" extension (by Ritwick Dey).
4. In the Explorer, right‑click `index.html` and choose "Open with Live Server".
5. Your default browser will open the site at a local URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5500`).

Tip: If you don't want Live Server, you can also open `index.html` directly in a browser.

## AI usage (short summary)
